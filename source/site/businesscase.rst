Outline Business Case
=====================

Identifying the Need
--------------------

In a world that is becoming internet connected at an exponential rate it can be very difficult to buy and manage infrastructure for internet based projects. As a result of this the market for cloud computing has become a huge area of growth for a lot of technology companies. As a sector it is estimated that cloud computing will be worth $200 Billion a year by the end of the decade.

Microsoft Azure is the second largest player in that sector, with Amazon being the largest. Microsoft's primary customers are large enterprises who obtain direct access to Microsoft technical support, and are able to afford the services of global consultancy services such as IBM and Accenture.

Smaller companies are driven towards Microsoft Partners to assist with deployments and technical solutions. However this does leave a lot of people and companies that fall through the gaps of that support model. There are sites like StackExchange that are geared to help but there is very little that is purely Azure focused.

This was the first idea behind starting the azured.io Slack channel, to become a place for people to have live conversations to obtain direct technical, and non-technical support. Since the support offered within azured.io relies almost purely on the community at large, the more people that can be brought into the community the better the support that will be offered will become.

The more people that can be brought into the community the more business opportunities we will be able to pursue.


Strategic Outline
-----------------

The overall strategy of azured.io focuses on a number of aims

1. To become a primary source of high quality support for Azure. That support would be in the form of documentation, forums and live chat facilities. As well as possibly providing support over voice and video conference.

2. As a long term aim to provide a source of income for those who provide the highest quality help

3. To be open to the opportunity to grow the business into alternative cloud markets such as Amazon Web Services. To ultimately provide a full service cloud support solution.

Identification of Options
-------------------------

1. **Do Nothing** - Allow the slack channel to grow organically. Over time its reputation of being a source of information should spread.

2. **Investigate options for fully functional site** - Aim to have a full release of the web site with a full compliment of services. Including a fully integrated chat channel, forums and any other support options that would come to light through a project designed to investigate them.

3. **Create a minimally viable product** - Create a website that initially has a very basic purpose and incrementally improve that over time.

Initial Option Appraisals
-------------------------

Options 2 would be by far the most difficult and expensive option, and certainly the option carrying the most risk. It would be problematic to identify at this stage what services would be beneficial to incoming customers. It is likely that a significant proportion of outlay would be wasted on features that would ultimately be unused.

Conversely option 1 would be the least expensive option, though not without risk. By allowing organic growth we would risk losing ground to any competitor that came forward. We would also risk any incoming customers not returning because there isn't enough activity on the channel.

This leaves option 3 as the most viable way forward at present. A project could be created to investigate what options there would be to create a minimally functional site. To identify what content that would need to start with and who would be responsible for creating and maintaining that site.

Initial Assessment of Affordability
-----------------------------------

Currently the azured.io concept has zero income. This means that any work that is performed to raise its profile will be impossible to finance at present. Any work that is performed would need to be provided under the condition that any invoice that is presented will remain unpaid for the foreseeable future.

The result of this would be that we are reliant on the altruistic tendencies of the community to buy into our vision and be willing to invest time and money to make the project viable.

Ultimately then it will be the benevolence of the community that will make the decision about whether we pursue option 1 or option 3.

Risk Assessment
---------------

The primary risk to the business is that there isn't enough community engagement to make it a viable resource for obtaining information on Azure services.
