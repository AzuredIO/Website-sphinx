Site Concept
------------

The purpose of this site is to document a program that has been created to expand the reach of the azured.io support site.
The program incorporates projects to create and improve the website.
To automate and integrate the development of that website. The expansion of the live chat facilities currently provided by Slack.
Finally a marketing project to drive promote the site to a wider audience.

While on the surface this is a simple website deployment. The intention is to document the decisions that are made as part of that process.
This will allow people to read these pages and understand how we came to each decision allowing them to extrapolate their own decisions from that.

Project Management
------------------

While typically there is little requirement to document the project management process of a small website construction.
By doing so in this case it can be used as an example of how to organise and process such a project.

The purpose of this part of the site is to document the entire process involved in creating this site.
To discuss the business and technical requirements involved when taking a website from a traditional largely static website to an automated, continuously integrated solution.

The process will document each incremental change to the site, covering the justification for the change, the cost of implementation, the deployment, testing and rollback procedures.
