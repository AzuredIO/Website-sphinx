Welcome to azured.io

If you are here for the azured.slack.com slack channel, you can sign up for it at `join.azured.io <http://join.azured.io>`_ or if you already have an account, you can sign in at `azured.slack.com <http://azured.slack.com>`_


Currently the rest of the site is very much a work in progress. The intention is to create a number of tutorials and introductions to Azure specifically and cloud computing in general.
There is also a plan to explore the project management aspects of taking a project from the initial program conception through the iterations that go into creating a resilient automated website.

At the moment everything is a work in progress, but hopefully we can create something that has some benefit to the wider community.
If you would like to help, join the channel and come and say hello in the #website-project channel.
